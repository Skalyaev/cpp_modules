# C++ Modules

*C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".*

## Objectives
The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.
This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended to learn OOP.
We decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from your old friend C.
Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will comply with the C++98 standard.
We are aware modern C++ is way different in a lot of aspects.
So if you want to become a proficient C++ developer, it’s up to you to go further after the 42 Common Core!
You will discover new concepts step-by-step. The exercises will progressively increase in complexity.
